        <h2>Project summary</h2>
        <p>PWC Cremer Assekuranz is a more than 80 year old insurance company with great tradition from Düsseldorf, Germany. The core business consists of insurances for bigger companies and wealthy private clients. The idea was to completely redesign the overall appereance without losing old values.</p>
        <p>A small local agency hired me as a freelance designer to tweak the webdesign concepts and give everything a more finalized and consistent look. I did also work on brand materials such as business cards and corporate letterheads.</p>

        <h2>Brand Redesign</h2>
        <p>The brand got a completely new look and feel. The only thing we kept is the old figurative mark. It's a memorable design element which old clients will instantly recognize. Everything else got a fresh new overhaul. This includes fonts, colors, the logo, imagery and of course the overall visual language. You can see some of my concepts and screenshots below.
